--MySQL Query --
-- Identify Entities:

Identify the main entities in the system. In this case, it's "Person" and "Ghana Card".
Define Attributes:
For each entity, list the attributes. For example:
Person: ID, First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Address, Nationality
Ghana Card: Card Number, Issue Date, Expiry Date
Identify Relationships:
Determine the relationships between entities. In this case, there's a one-to-many relationship between "Person" and "Ghana Card", as one person can have multiple Ghana cards.
Represent Entities and Attributes:
Draw rectangles to represent entities. Write the entity name inside the rectangle.
List the attributes inside the respective entity rectangles.
Represent Relationships:
Use lines to connect related entities.
Label the lines with the type of relationship (e.g., "one-to-many").

    ID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    First_Name VARCHAR(50),
    Last_Name VARCHAR(50),
    Date_of_Birth DATE,
    Gender VARCHAR(10),
    Address VARCHAR(100),

);

CREATE TABLE Ghana_Card (
    Card_Number INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Issue_Date DATE,
    Expiry_Date DATE,
    Person_ID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Person_ID) REFERENCES Person(ID)
);
